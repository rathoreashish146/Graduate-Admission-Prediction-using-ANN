# Graduate Admission Prediction using ANN

## Introduction
Graduate Admission Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a method of predicting the likelihood of a graduate student being accepted into a particular program or university based on their academic and personal profile. This project utilizes an ANN model to analyze various factors such as academic scores, statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, etc., and provides a prediction of the admission outcome.

## Features
- Predicts the likelihood of a graduate student being accepted into a specific program or university.
- Utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for accurate prediction.
- Considers various factors such as academic scores, statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, etc., in the prediction process.
- The ANN model is trained using a labeled dataset containing profiles and admission outcomes.
- The project aims to assist students in making informed decisions about their graduate studies.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare your dataset by ensuring it follows the required format.
4. Run the main application script: `python admission_prediction.py`

## Usage
1. Ensure that the dataset is properly loaded and preprocessed by running the data preprocessing script: `python data_preprocessing.py`.
2. Train the ANN model by executing the training script: `python train_model.py`.
3. Once the model is trained, the main application script can be used to predict the likelihood of admission for a given student profile: `python admission_prediction.py`.
